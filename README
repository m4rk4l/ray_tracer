This directory contains an implementation of a raytracer.
Authors: Marco Anton & Ben Dana

to compile a fresh program:
    - make fresh
to run raytracer:
    - make run
one can change the input files by changing the ''Makefile'' file.
User can just change the Macro INPUT.

Our created files can be found on input/v0/
We couldn't find the previous version of our ray tracer.
And couldn't come up with specTile.txt since our functions were not
producing them.

TODO:
    - Parsing objects correctly (More error checking!!!).
    - creating image (DONE, adding more images to be created.)
    - write image to stdout (DONE)

NOT WORKING:
    procedural spheres - one of our functions is not working as expected
                         (input/v0/proc1.txt).
    Tiled Planes - gives a segfault.
    Specular light - doesn't work properly
