This file contains an implementation of a raytracer.
Authors: Marco Anton & Ben Dana

to run a fresh program:
    - make fresh
to run raytracer:
    - make run
one can change the input files by changing the ''Makefile'' file. user should
scroll to the bootom and change the run target

also, our created images are in input/in01.txt and input/in02.txt

our program expects the following format:
x x     world x and y dims
x x x   viewpoint location

x       object
x x x   ambient
x x x   diffuse
x x x   specular

x x x   the following lines are object spcific.
x x     one must leave a blank line between obj specific
x x x   data and the next object
...

TODO:
    - Parsing objects correctly  (done, could improve reading obj. as long
      there are lines, keep trying to read objects).
    - creating image (DONE, adding more images to be created.)
    - write image to stdout (DONE)

NOT WORKING
    - need to take care of memery leaks!!!
    - working on procedural planes - checkout pplane.h/c
    - need to figure out which formula to use in the projection funciton
      see veclib.c/veclib.h

Working on:
    - freeing sphere objects. need to use valgrind to do some extra checking.
    - also trying to get procedural planes to work
