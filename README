This file contains an implementation of a raytracer.
Authors: Marco Anton & Ben Dana

to run a fresh program:
    - make fresh
to run raytracer:
    - make run
one can change the input files by changing the ''Makefile'' file. user should
scroll to the bootom and change the run target

also, our created images are in input/in01.txt and input/in02.txt

TODO:
    - Parsing objects correctly  (done, could improve reading obj. as long
      there are lines, keep trying to read objects)
    - creating image (somewhat working.)
    - write image to stdout (DONE)

NOT WORKING
    some images don't show or show wrong output. need to have debuging working
    to see where is the error.
        - planes:
          planes are working, however, need to check boundary regions.
        - spheres:
bla
